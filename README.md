# beta-chordloops.net
The current public version of the website's code

The "generator" page (experiment.html) is where the user creates their preset. Pressing "start" then brings them to the loops page (experiment-session.html), where music is actually generated.
So the most interesting code is in experiment-session.html, which is based on code from session-VOICING.js and session-RHYTHM.js. 

I didn't really write this code with readablity in mind so I apologize that if it is confusing... I have a new version that should be released around November 27th, with 
not only way more features and a vastly improved user experience, but also way faster & cleaner code
